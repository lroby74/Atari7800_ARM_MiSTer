// Minnie's microcode sequencer. This is the FPGA stand-in for the control PLA.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Two counters, and why they are separate
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// "As the Minnie is operated directly from the 1.8 MHz clock, this allows for
// 64 internal microcode states for each complete sample calculation."
// 1.789772 MHz / 64 = 27.965 kHz.
//
//   tick    free running, 0..63, one step per processor clock. Never stalls.
//           Its wrap is the sample clock.
//   voice   0..2, and step 0..9 within a voice. Thirty states of real work.
//           A processor access holds these for one state.
//
// The separation is what produces the behaviour section 2.4.2 describes.
// Processor accesses steal microcode states but cannot steal ticks, so:
//
//   work finishes before the wrap    -> latch T, clear it, start the next pass
//   work has not finished at a wrap  -> the previous sample is held, and the
//                                       pass finishes into the following window
//
// which is exactly "cause the Minnie to repeat a sample on all its voices,
// essentially slipping one sample in time". The slip is uniform across voices
// because the pass is never abandoned partway, only delayed.
//
// The specification quotes a budget of 16 accesses per tick. This schedule
// leaves 34 idle states, so it tolerates 34 - one more than it needs to,
// because our thirty-state schedule is tighter than whatever GCC's was. The
// mechanism is the specified one; only the headroom differs.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Stalling
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Processor accesses land on the bus phase and microcode states advance on the
// other, so they never share a clock. An access raises a flag that swallows the
// next state advance. "Bus access arbitration is made fairly simple by virtue
// of the fact that the processor always wins."
