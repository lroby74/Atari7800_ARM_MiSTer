// Minnie waveform storage and the "free waveform" logic of GCC-1730 section 2.3.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Storage is RAM here, not the mask ROM the specification describes
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// GCC chose ROM on die area, not on technology - Namco's WSG had CPU writable
// wave RAM in 1980, and GCC built their business on Pac-Man hardware. A static
// cell is five to ten times the area of a mask ROM bit, and 1024 bits of it did
// not fit under a $1.00 cost ceiling. On an M10K the difference is a write port.
//
// The memory powers up holding the same two waveforms the mask would have, so a
// program that never touches WAVEADDR/WAVEDATA behaves exactly like the
// documented chip.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Waveform select, section 2.2.1.4.2
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   0  stored waveform 0        6 index bits address one of 64 samples
//   1  stored waveform 1
//   2  not used                 blank
//   3  not used                 blank
//   4  off, "outputs a -1"
//   5  sawtooth                 the 8 index MSBs, unchanged
//   6  square                   the index MSB alone
//   7  triangle                 XOR fold of the index MSBs
//
// Codes 2, 3 and 4 all give $FF. That is not a coincidence we invented: in an
// NMOS NOR ROM an unprogrammed row reads as all ones, so a blank row IS -1.
// The specification documenting code 4 as "off (outputs a -1)" is describing
// what a blank row does, and codes 2 and 3 are simply blank rows nobody named.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The triangle needs an inverter the specification does not mention
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Section 2.3 says the triangle "uses the MSB to exclusive-OR the 7 next most
// significant bits, shifted up by one. A zero is shifted up into the LSB."
// Taken literally that gives a clean triangle 0..254 read as UNSIGNED, which
// read as two's complement jumps by 129 mid cycle. Inverting the output MSB is
// the standard offset binary to two's complement fix and costs one inverter:
//
//   index[15:8]   0        64       127  128       192       255
//   raw fold      $00      $80      $FE  $FE       $7E       $00
//   MSB inverted  $80      $00      $7E  $7E       $FE       $80
//   as signed     -128 ->  0   ->  +126 +126  ->   -2   ->  -128     continuous
//
// The sawtooth needs no such fix - the top 8 index bits read as two's
// complement are already a correct ramp, half a period out of phase. The
// specification saying "unchanged" for the sawtooth while describing extra
// logic for the triangle is indirect support for reading it this way.
