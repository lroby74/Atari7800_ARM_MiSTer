// Minnie's output section: what the analog spec asked a subcontractor for.
//
// The 10 bit sample is held for a whole 27.965 kHz tick, so what leaves the
// chip is a staircase with images at 28 kHz and above. On the real cartridge
// those were dealt with by a first or second order pole in the output buffer,
// then the RF modulator, then the television's own audio bandwidth. None of
// that exists here and the framework resamples to 48 kHz, so the images would
// fold back audibly if the sample were simply widened and handed over.
//
//   +-----------+     +-------------+     +---------------+
//   | DC block  | --> | 1 pole low  | --> | scale and     |
//   | ~17 Hz    |     | pass 4.4kHz |     | bias          |
//   +-----------+     +-------------+     +---------------+
//
// DC block: the 3600 board "capacitively couples the incoming signal presented
// on the external audio line" through 1 uF into 6.8 kohms, which is a 23 Hz
// high pass. Modelling it matters for more than tidiness - waveform 4 outputs
// -1 rather than 0, and the square wave sits 64 counts low, so without it every
// volume change would step the DC level.
//
// Low pass: the specification asks for "approximately 4 KHz", first or second
// order. One pole at 4.4 kHz, run at the processor clock rather than the sample
// rate, because a reconstruction filter has to run faster than the staircase it
// is smoothing.
//
// Scale and bias: the core's mixer is unsigned, so the result is re-biased to
// sit mid range. That is not a fudge - the real output pin sourced current into
// an AC coupled load, and the analog spec says so: "allowing the output pin to
// be biased up to any level desired".
//
// Both filters are shift-and-accumulate, no multiplier and no divider, with
// fractional bits carried so the truncation cannot stall them.
