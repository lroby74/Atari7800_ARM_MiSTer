// Minnie's noise source: the "15 stage poly counter" of GCC-1730 section 2.1.3.
//
// The specification gives the length and nothing else - no taps, no clock rate,
// no seed. Those are invented here.
//
//   taps    x^15 + x^14 + 1, maximal length, period 32767. Two gate feedback,
//           the same idiom POKEY uses for its 17 and 9 bit polys.
//   clock   once per microcode state, not once per sample. The three voices
//           read it at different states, so this is what decorrelates them.
//           Clocking per sample would give all three the same value.
//   seed    all ones. XOR feedback locks up at all zeros, so the seed must not
//           be zero and reset must not clear it.
